# cstimer-tl--
This program, built from Python, is designed to read cstimer .json files, and graph them in a way to provide more information about the user's solves. Currently, support
is only for Windows.


The timeline, or the "time trend" tool in cstimer seemingly does not graph the time axis, and I have always wanted to see what the actual time trend of my solves would
look like. Therefore, I have made, and will continue to maintain this tool, for my own endeavours as a speedcuber.


Currently, the tool is in build phase of creation, and I will slowly add more features, such as ao5, ao12, etc, support for time splits, and better graphics & 
optimisation. As this is build phase, there will be many bugs, and if you encounter one, feel no hesitation to submit an issue here! I will look into it and I'll put as 
much effort as possible into solving them.
