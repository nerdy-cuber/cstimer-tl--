# cstimer-tl--
This program, built from Python, is designed to read cstimer .json files, and graph them in a way to provide more information about the user's solves. Currently, support is only for Windows.


The timeline, or the "time trend" tool in cstimer seemingly does not graph the time axis, and I have always wanted to see what the actual time trend of my solves would look like. Therefore, I have made, and will continue to maintain this tool, for my own endeavours as a speedcuber.


Currently, the project is in very early build, and has near 0 features added. More features will be planned to be added soon, including an ao5, ao12 etc graph viewer, custom colours, and

Libraries:
Numpy
Matplotlib


Installation:
To download this, simply download the .exe file and run it. You will be asked to open a .txt or a .json cstimer file. Afterwards, choose a session and see your plot!
